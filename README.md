# CCircuit
Linux C++ Terminal Basic Circuit Simulator

This is a simple circuit simulator, including tools such as wire, bridge, AND/OR/XOR/NOT, flip-flops, and more.
A preview of a creation can be seen here: https://youtu.be/sYgxDcVWrM8

Note: if you are actually crazy enough to try and compile this for your machine, and use it, you'll have to convert all the controls from Dvorak to Qwerty (I'll maybe add a bilingual option, one day), and just a heads up: it automatically un/gzips saves :)
