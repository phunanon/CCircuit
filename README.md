### Linux C++ Terminal Basic Circuit Simulator

After having so much fun as a 15 y/o redstone Minecrafter, I was hungry for more control. Physical electronics was too painstaking (and expensive!) for my desire to create logic circuits. Other software was too busy and professional, trying to simulate the real thing (though ![simulator.io](https://simulator.io) does a good job!). So, I made this logic circuit simulator which functions as a dynamic 2D breadboard. It includes building blocks such as wire, bridge, AND/XOR/NOT, flip-flops, timers, copy-paste, undo-redo, and much more. It's become my favourite project!

It even works on Android! Just replace the gzip provider to BusyBox
